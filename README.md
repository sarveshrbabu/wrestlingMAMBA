MOE mamba alignment 

**Milestone goals:**
We are going to be building off of some existing code for a baseline MAMBA MOE that uses switch circuits similar to existing literature.
Then based on that implementation begin running experiments on what architectural changes cause better performance.  
We likely plan to try to align the model based on the ALPACA training gym - and test our different architectural changes.
