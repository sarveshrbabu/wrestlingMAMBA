# wrestlingMAMBA

Welcome to wrestlingMAMBA, a cutting-edge project focused on enhancing and stress testing the MOE (Mixture of Experts) MAMBA architecture.

## Project Overview

wrestlingMAMBA aims to build upon existing MOE Mamba models, specifically focusing on those that utilize switch circuits, a concept well-documented in existing literature. Our mission is to explore and identify architectural modifications that significantly improve model performance, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

### Milestone Goals

- **Baseline Implementation**: Our initial step involves creating a baseline MAMBA MOE model, drawing inspiration from existing code and literature surrounding switch circuits. This will serve as our foundation for further experimentation.

- **Architectural Experiments**: With our baseline model established, we will embark on a series of experiments to test various architectural changes. Our objective is to pinpoint modifications that lead to superior performance metrics.

- **ALPACA Alignment**: A crucial phase of our project involves aligning our model with the ALPACA training gym. This alignment will not only provide a standardized framework for testing but also allow us to benchmark our model's performance against a well-defined set of criteria.

## Getting Started

To get started with wrestlingMAMBA, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine to gain access to the baseline code and resources.

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the project's structure and the existing implementation by reviewing the documentation provided in the `/docs` folder.

4. **Run Experiments**: Utilize the scripts in the `/experiments` folder to run your own architectural experiments. Detailed instructions for conducting these experiments are provided within the folder.
